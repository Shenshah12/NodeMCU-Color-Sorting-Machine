# NodeMCU-Color-Sorting-Machine
## Introduction
This is my semester project for the course Microprocessor and Microcontroller Based Design. The goal of this project is to sort mixed color balls based on their detected color using NodeMCU and a color sensor.
## How It Works
The color sorting machine is straightforward in its functionality. The user places mixed color balls on a slide. As the balls move through, a color sensor detects their color, and then a servo motor moves the ball to the corresponding cup for its color.

## Materials Used
NodeMCU (ESP8266)
TCS3200 Color Sensor
2x Servo Motors
Jumper Wires
Breadboard
Cardboard (for the structure)
Color Balls
Cups (to collect sorted balls)
Micro USB Cable
## Limitations
The machine is currently capable of sorting only three colors: Red, Green, and Blue.
